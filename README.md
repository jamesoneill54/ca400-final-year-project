## Project Overview

This project will aim to properly simulate colonies and individual ants using Artificial Intelligence, and simulate their evolution from generation to generation in the Darwinist style. We will then use our trained ants to solve real world problems such as emergency vehicle response following natural disasters. 

Ants in a colony have different jobs and goals within the colony, such as collecting food, defending the colony, looking after the young, removing rubbish etc. Each of these jobs must be distributed equally among the ants, no matter if some ants die or more ants are born. This project will simulate ants performing their jobs for the upkeep of the colony. 

This project will also, on a smaller scale, aim to outline the importance of [biomimicry][biomimicry-link] in modern design.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

This project is a study on Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms through the implementation and simulation of a Virtual Ant Colony. 
We intend to train our virtual ant colony to solve fastest route problems in real time and apply their behaviour to emergency response vehicles facing the same problems.
We are also going to implement various subspecies of ant in our simulations based on differing traits and allow users to alter these traits to suit their desired needs.

Ant Colony Optimisation Algorithms were first implemented by Marco Dorigo (IRIDIA, Brussels) in 1992.
Dorigo used nodes and edges to represent his virtual ants and their environment, using his trained 'ants' to solve a classic Travelling Salesman problem.
Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) Algorithms are modelled on the behaviour of ants searching for food.
In Nature, ant colonies work as a unit while foraging for food, with each individual ant leaving chemical trails known as pheromones, that can then be smelled by other ants on the route.
The ants work together to find the stronger pheromone paths and over time find the quickest route to and from their desired food source. 
This project will involve studying Stigmergy in nature and how to apply it in the context of Machine Learning.

Our virtual ant colony will be displayed in a GUI environment for users to view their behaviour over time in finding their fastest routes.
Important nodes in this environment will include the Ant Hill (Home), Food Sources (goals) and various obstacles which will cut off paths.
Obstacles will appear by the  user's hand or at random during any simulation, and the ants must adapt to find the shortest route to their goals based on these environmental changes.

As a further study into ant behaviour and biomimiry in modern design, we want to simulate different species of ant colony and have them interact within our GUI environment.
We plan on doing this by having our basic ant class become an interface for our various subspecies and introduce different traits based on ant colonies in the wild e.g size, speed, repopulation rate etc. 
This will allow users to play around with different attributes of the ants to see what factors may improve their ant's optimal route, and will also allow the simulation of two rival colonies trying to access the same resource.

### 1.3 Glossary

- Travelling Salesman Problem: An optimisation algorithm problem defined by mathematicians W.R. Hamilton and Thomas Kirkman, with a focus on finding the cheapest, shortest or fastest route around a graph of nodes.
- Pheromones: a chemical substance produced and released into the environment by a mammal or insect, affecting the behaviour or physiology of others of its species.
- Stigmergy: a mechanism of indirect coordination in which the trace left by an action in a medium stimulates subsequent actions
- GUI: A graphical user interface, a computer environment that simplifies the user's interaction with the computer by offering visual elements to the user.
- Biomimicry: the design and production of materials, structures and systems that are modelled on biological entities and processes
